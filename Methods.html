		<h1>Methods</h1>
		<p>     I will utilize qualitative research methods in order to explore this vital question. I will first give participants a questionnaire to determine whether they would identify their households as food insecure. Next, I will conduct in-person interviews that will be centered on the use of the garden and how the participants engage with it. 
	        </p>
		<p>
     I chose to use a qualitative interview-based method because I believe that this will allow me to get more in-depth descriptions of how community gardens are being utilized than if I used a purely survey-based approach. In addition, I would like participants to be able to speak about the barriers to access they might be experiencing and not simply respond to what I imagine the barriers might be. However, I will use the survey to allow me to understand the basic characteristics of each family and be able to address sensitive questions on paper rather than in-person.
	       </p>
		<p>
      I will interview a diverse range of participants. I will speak to those who own plots at the two sites who are experiencing food insecurity, and those who are not. I will also interview those who live near both gardens but do not use the space (both those who are experiencing food insecurity, and those who are not). Interviewing all of these groups will allow me to make some observations about the demographics both of the neighborhoods where the gardens are located, and of the garden itself. I will then be able to compare participantsâ€™ answers. I will interview 15 participants who are within one mile of each site. The focus of my study will be those living within the immediate vicinity of the community gardens. 
		</p>
		<h4> Design </h4>
		<p>
     The participants will first fill out a short questionnaire regarding food security in their households. The survey will contain questions attempting to understand if participants have adequate access to a nutritious diet. I will also include questions about whether participants value eating fresh fruit and vegetables. The following is an example of the type of questions that would be asked on the survey. 
		</p>

How often do you find yourself struggling to obtain food for you/your family?
Never 
Occasionally 
Every month 
Every week
Every day

How often do you find yourself struggling to obtain fruit and vegetables for you/your family?
Never 
Occasionally 
Every month 
Every week
Every day
	        <p>
     During the interview portion, I will ask a series of questions which would first determine if the participant or participant's family owned a plot or worked in one of the community gardens. I will then ask those who own plots about their experience with working in the garden, what is going well and what they might be struggling with. The interviews will be participant-led. 
		</p>
		<p>
        For those who did not work in either garden, my interview would likely be far shorter and I would ask about whether they had ever been interested in working in the garden and what had made them decide not to work in the garden. 
		</p>
		<p>
      The control group in my study will be those who did not identify their households as food insecure. Therefore, I will be able to identify the difference in responses between those who identified themselves as food insecure and those who did not.
		</p>
		<p>
     There are a number of unintentional factors that could affect the results of the study. First, there is a possibility that survey or interview questions could contain biased or leading questions. To work to prevent this bias, I will create open-ended questions so as not to influence participants in both interview and questionnaire and attempt to let participants lead the discussion. 
		</p>
		<p>
      In addition, those who want to participate in the study are more likely to be those who are invested in their neighborhood's community garden, which could skew the results. In an attempt to offset this issue, I will offer a 30-dollar payment to those who wanted to participate in the study and emphasize that even those who did not work/were not interested in community gardens could participate. 
		</p>
		<p>
     Finally, there is a possibility that participants might not share information or modify their answers due to feeling uncomfortable talking about money, food insecurity, or struggles related to poverty. I will attempt to make the interview subjects as comfortable as possible by allowing them to lead the discussion, and being respectful of their boundaries.
		</p>
		<h4>Analysis</h4>
		<p>
       I will record and create an intelligent transcription of the interviews and use inductive coding to identify themes, particularly taking note of references to barriers to access.  I will take note of how many people who are experiencing food insecurity are working in one of the gardens and how many people who identified their household as food secure are working at one of the sites. I will analyze the responses of those who did not work in the garden to identify possible barriers to access, examine the responses of participants who own garden plots and take note of the type of issues they might be experiencing. I will be particularly interested in comparing the experiences of those who identified their households as food insecure to the experiences of those who did not. 
		</p>
		<p>
     If my hypothesis is confirmed, I will find significantly fewer people experiencing food insecurity working in either of the gardens. In addition, I would likely see those experiencing food insecurity reporting more difficulty during the gardening process. 
		</p>
		<p>
     My hypothesis would be disconfirmed if I found that there is a significantly greater number of people who are experiencing food insecurity working in the community gardens and that they had little to no issues with the gardening process.
		</p>
		<p>
       It must be noted that any combination of the above results may occur, which would create some ambiguity. However, these results would still be useful. For example, if I were to find that there were a great number of people experiencing food insecurity working within the garden, but that many were struggling with the gardening process, this would still be valuable information.
