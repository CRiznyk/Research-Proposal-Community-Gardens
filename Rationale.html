		<h1>Rationale</h1>
		<p>
			 These are the types of questions this study will shed light on. I plan to investigate the question: are there barriers to access to community gardens in North Portland for those experiencing food insecurity? It is vital to see whether those who do not have access to healthy foods such as fresh produce are benefiting from these gardens. 
        Speaking to local community members will provide more insight into how people are engaging with the gardens. This study will provide more information on whether the gardens are accessible and explore what makes a community garden more or less accessible. I predict that there are significant barriers to accessing community gardens in North Portland for those experiencing food insecurity. 
     If my hypothesis is confirmed, it will show that more work needs to be done in community gardens in North Portland in order to make them more accessible to those experiencing food insecurity. In addition, I should be able to determine what these barriers to access might be. Alternatively, if I find major complaints about how these gardens are functioning they may need to be reimagined altogether. 
     If my hypothesis is proved false, my research will show that community gardens in North Portland are being utilized by those experiencing food insecurity and effectively providing fresh produce to those individuals. In addition, if the community gardens greatly improve food security in communities, there should be an effort to create more of them.
