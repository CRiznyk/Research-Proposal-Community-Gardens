		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<h2> Community Gardens and Food Insecurity in Portland, Oregon </h2>
		<h4> Clio Riznyk </h4>
     <p>
       The term community garden can be used to describe any  public collective gardening effort, often in an urban space. However, in the United States, it often refers to an area in which individuals, groups, or families in the local community own plots of land within a garden (Public Health Law Center, 2017). Many of these gardens are created to provide gardening space to those who may not have access to the resources and land needed in order to garden.
	
    </p>
    <p>
     These gardens are placed in communities for a number of reasons, including improving social capital within communities, beautifying neighborhoods, and providing food (namely fresh produce) to communities and individuals experiencing food insecurity (Firth et al., 2011). It is vital to understand whether these gardens are actually meeting these goals. 
   </p>
    <p>
     Studies have shown that community gardens may not always achieve as much good for a  community as originally hoped. For example, Lowan-Trudeau et al. (2020) found that there were significant barriers to accessing community gardens for visible minorities, while Glover (2010) found that community gardens could cause social discord within communities. 
   </p>
   <p>
       I will be examining community gardens from a food systems approach. This means that I will be looking at the distribution of healthy food in communities and attempting to understand if community gardens are creating more access to these healthy foods for those who are experiencing food insecurity.
  </p>
  <p>
     I will be studying two case study gardens in North Portland, Oregon, USA. The two sites are <a href="https://www.portland.gov/parks/beach-community-garden">Beach Community Garden</a>
				
	 and <a href="http://www.villagegardens.org/news/2012/11/14/seeds-of-harmony-garden">
 </p>
  <p>
	  
	  Seeds of Harmony Community Garden</a> Beach Community Garden is located in the Overlook neighborhood, which has a relatively high average household income, while Seeds of Harmony is located in New Columbia Village which is a planned community with a low average household income (BestNeighborhood.org, n.d.). Conducting research in gardens in neighborhoods with varying income levels will provide more detailed information on how the average income level in an area may affect how accessible these gardens are for those experiencing food insecurity.
