		<h1>Community Gardens and Food Insecurity</h1>
		<p>The term community garden can be used to describe any somewhat public collective gardening effort, often in an urban area. 
In the United States, the term often refers to an area in which a local community has a share of gardening space and individuals, groups, or families own plots of land within that space.
